	            <div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Sidorakh</h2>
					<p>Siddy, you're one of the first people I met in this server. You were always there to help me, whether it be with GML, some other programming language, or personal stuff. It's been really cool getting to watch you turn into an admin, and take on all the responsibility it's entailed. You've done a great job, and I hope we get to see you keep doing it for a while &#58;&#41;</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Juju</h2>
					<p>Juju, I didn't really get to talk to you much until fairly recently. However, you've been nothing but incredibly kind to me, and patient in putting up with my bad code. I'm so incredibly greatful for what you've done for this server.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Topherlicious</h2>
					<p>Toph, you've always been a bit quieter in #lounge. However, that hasn't stopped you from helping everyone in the server constantly. A lot of the people who just come for help aren't able to see the insane amount of work you put into the server, especially regarding the bot. I just want you to know that those of us that know, really appreciate all you've done for us!</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">net8floz</h2>
					<p>Net, you were one of the first people to help me on this server. Because of you, I've become a better programmer. You've given up time out of your day to help me pick majors for school, and to teach me basic programming concepts. All of this is stuff you didn't have to do, but you did anyways, out of the kindness of your heart. That's pretty cool.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Jon Peterson (The Pixelated Pope)</h2>
					<p>Pope, we haven't really talked much. Honestly, I hardly know anything about you. But what I do know, is that you've been very patient with me, despite me being obnoxious at certain points in time. You are constantly helping folks in the help channels, and while I don't really comment on it, I see all the work you do. I think we're all pretty lucky you're in the server, because you've helped hundreds of people with thousands of questions, and all out of the kindness of your heart.</p>

				<h2>Green Names</h2>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Minty Python</h2>
					<p>Mimps, you've helped me with more Java errors than my actual Java teacher has. When I joined the r/GameMaker discord, I never expected to be doing code-golf in perl and javascript, and getting help with Java. But you guys all help me anyways, because it's a community. And it's a community that cares about its members. Thank you for all you do for the server!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Kuholaid</h2>

				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Rohbert</h2>

				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Hypnoziz</h2>
					<p>Hypno, you're very rarely on the server. However, you're constantly helping people out on the reddit. You're kind, and have more patience than I do. I can't thank you enough for being a part of the moderation team!</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Toothsoup</h2>
					<p>Tooth, I'm not even too sure you're in the discord. However, you do moderate the reddit a lot, and I'm glad you do. You make sure everyone is on topic, you give resources, and help. Thank you.</p>

You always have an answer to a programminng question, and that answer is usually "regex" :p In seriousness, you've been a great help to this server. You know what needs to be done to fix a problem, and you know how to put that into words that anyone can understand without difficulty. Thanks for being a part of the server :)</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">

					<h2 id="name">Tony</h2>
					<p>Tony, my dear window. You let light into this server. It's tough remembering the times when you weren't a duck, because to me it seemed like a no-brainer that you should be one.
