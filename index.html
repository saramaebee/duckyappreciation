				<h2 id="name">Anonymous</h2>
				<p>"They help with all kinds of stuff! Mainly, I've asked for help with especially gnarly code issues, but, as I move into producing more assets for my project, I expect I'll be leaning on the community more for art help as well.""</p>

				<p>"The ducks and staff are some of the most welcoming and patient people I have met. Because of them, I have had resources and lessons that I've needed to start taking the first steps in becoming an developer as a career. Without them and this server, I honest to god would still be screaming at my computer when drag and drop didn't work for me. :popebless: &lt;3"</p>

				<p>They are always explaining themselves well and understandable and are helping all of us out.</p>
				<p>I'm not as good at programming as some, so I often have trouble fixing a bug or implementing something I didn't before. This often happens in game jams where every little bit of time is needed. I can't even think of how many hours and hours of useless thinking these people have saved me, so I really hope this message will cheer them up a little bit more!"</p>
