Because of them, I have had resources and lessons that I've needed to start taking the first steps in becoming an developer as a career.

				<p>I'm not as good at programming as some, so I often have trouble fixing a bug or implementing something I didn't before. This often happens in game jams where every little bit of time is needed. I can't even think of how many hours and hours of useless thinking these people have saved me, so I really hope this message will cheer them up a little bit more!"</p>

					<p>Siddy, you're one of the first people I met in this server. You were always there to help me, whether it be with GML, some other programming language, or personal stuff. It's been really cool getting to watch you turn into an admin, and take on all the responsibility it's entailed. You've done a great job, and I hope we get to see you keep doing it for a while &#58;&#41;</p>

				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">Topherlicious</h2>
					<p>Toph, you've always been a bit quieter in #lounge. However, that hasn't stopped you from helping everyone in the server constantly. A lot of the people who just come for help aren't able to see the insane amount of work you put into the server, especially regarding the bot. I just want you to know that those of us that know, really appreciate all you've done for us!</p>

				<div class="currentevents">
					<h2 id="name">net8floz</h2>
					<p>Net, you were one of the first people to help me on this server. Because of you, I've become a better programmer. You've given up time out of your day to help me pick majors for school, and to teach me basic programming concepts. All of this is stuff you didn't have to do, but you did anyways, out of the kindness of your heart. That's pretty cool.</p>

But what I do know, is that you've been very patient with me, despite me being obnoxious at certain points in time. You are constantly helping folks in the help channels, and while I don't really comment on it, I see all the work you do. I think we're all pretty lucky you're in the server, because you've helped hundreds of people with thousands of questions, and all out of the kindness of your heart.</p>

					<p>Mimps, you've helped me with more Java errors than my actual Java teacher has. When I joined the r/GameMaker discord, I never expected to be doing code-golf in perl and javascript, and getting help with Java. But you guys all help me anyways, because it's a community.
